 Airqualitybot - Hackathon
2022 Hackathon: Blue Sky Challenge
Introduction. “Monitoring air quality in various cities across the globe is becoming an utmost necessity as air pollution can lead to several respiratory/ cardiovascular diseases. More than 7 million mortalities have been recorded worldwide due to diseases related to air pollution. Increasing urbanization and industrialization have a negative impact on air quality which is already alarming in many cities across the world (WHO, 2021). In practice, the instillation of ground stations for local air quality measurement would not be a feasible solution. A mobile application in this regard would enable us to make an informed decision.”

[Advanced Lvl] Discover new innovative solutions for developing smart, mobile air quality monitoring systems

How to use:
This is a Discord bot, so it has to be used in a discord server. Use the command "!a (zip code)" to find the air quality of your selected city. The bot will return a message containing the air quality index and various air pollutants. The color of the sidebar reflects the quality of air (green = good, yellow = moderate, etc.)
